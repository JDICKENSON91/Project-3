## Proposal

I will create a data visualisation using leaflet.js to show how the population of humans has grown in every city and how it is projected to grow.
I will have multiple charts showing different aspects of the populations by City or Country.

I am aiming to have compariable maps 1900 Vs 2000 (Posssibly Panning) to compare how populations have grown. This will also be shown on a line graph.
